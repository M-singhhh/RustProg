# Rust Programming 
//Python is Dynamically Linked. When you run a script, it doesn't "own" the math logic; it just asks the Python Interpreter (already installed on your OS) to do it.
Rust is Statically Linked by default. It pulls the entire LLVM backend, your ndarray dependency, and the std library into a single Self-Contained Executable.
